# Weather App 🌦️

Welcome to the **Weather App** repository! This is a simple, user-friendly web application that displays real-time weather information based on the user's current location. The app is developed using **JavaScript** and leverages a weather API to provide accurate and up-to-date weather data.

## 📋 Features

- **Automatic Location Detection**: The app uses the browser's geolocation API to detect the user's location automatically.
- **Real-Time Weather Information**: Displays current weather conditions, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather descriptions.
- **Dynamic Weather Icons**: Shows relevant weather icons that match the current weather conditions (e.g., sunny, cloudy, rainy).
- **Minimalistic and Responsive Design**: Designed with simplicity in mind, the app works seamlessly on all devices—desktop, tablet, and mobile.
- **Background Update**: The app dynamically updates the background based on weather conditions, providing a visually engaging experience.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **JavaScript**: Handles geolocation, API calls, and dynamic content updates.
- **HTML & CSS**: Provides the structure and styling for the application.
- **Weather API**: Integrates with an external weather API (such as OpenWeatherMap) to fetch real-time weather data.

## 🚀 Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/weather-app.git
   ```
2. **Open the Project**:  
   Navigate to the project directory and open `index.html` in your web browser.

3. **API Key Setup**:  
   Obtain an API key from a weather service provider (like OpenWeatherMap) and replace the placeholder in the JavaScript file:
   ```javascript
   const apiKey = 'YOUR_API_KEY_HERE';
   ```

## 🔧 How It Works

1. **Geolocation**: The app uses the browser's geolocation feature to get the user's latitude and longitude.
2. **Fetch Weather Data**: It sends a request to the weather API using the location coordinates to get current weather data.
3. **Display Data**: The app updates the UI with the fetched weather data, including temperature, conditions, and more.
